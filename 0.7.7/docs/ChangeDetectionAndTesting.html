         <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction<a href="#Introduction" class="section_anchor"></a></h1>
         <p>A general guideline for a build tool is that you should be able to trust its outputs. This is especially relevant to compiling Scala sources because the Scala compiler is slow and so there is a sizable amount of code in <tt>sbt</tt> to speed up compilation times. </p>
         <p>One simple way <tt>sbt</tt> speeds up compilation is to run the compiler in the same virtual machine each time. (Note that this is not quite the same as <tt>fsc</tt>, which reuses the same compiler instance.) This approach results in a speedup by a factor of 2 after the first compile. </p>
         <p>A second way to speed up compilation times is to only recompile sources that are out of date. This approach requires some work to do properly. A sign of failing to do it properly is users running <tt>clean</tt> as part of their normal development cycle. The motivation behind <tt>sbt</tt>'s scripted test framework is to try to find bugs in <tt>sbt</tt>'s partial recompilation so that compilation works as expected and <tt>clean</tt> is something you don't need to do to get correct outputs. </p>
         <p>The basic steps to create a scripted test are: </p>
         <ol>
          <li>Create a project that will form the base </li>
          <li>Determine the changes to make to that project and any actions to invoke on the project </li>
          <li>Create the files comprising the changes </li>
          <li>Create a script that consists of statements that apply the changes and invoke actions on the project, declaring whether the actions should succeed or fail. </li>
         </ol>
         <p></p>
         <p>The first part discusses partial recompilation in <tt>sbt</tt> and the second part describes scripted tests. </p>
         <h1><a name="Partial_Recompilation"></a>Partial Recompilation<a href="#Partial_Recompilation" class="section_anchor"></a></h1>
         <p>You have a set of Scala source files that you would like to compile. After the initial compilation, you typically only modify some of those files before recompiling. This section describes how <tt>sbt</tt> determines which files have been changed and which files need to be recompiled. </p>
         <p>The steps to partial recompilation are generally: </p>
         <ol>
          <li>Determine which sources have been modified. </li>
          <li>Determine which sources need to be recompiled. </li>
          <li>Remove outdated classes. </li>
          <li>Recompile. </li>
         </ol>
         <p></p>
         <p>There are a few indications that a source has changed: </p>
         <ol>
          <li>It no longer exists. </li>
          <li>Its last modified time is more recent than the timestamp for the last compile. </li>
          <li>Its last modified time is more recent than the last modified time of one of the classes produced from it. </li>
          <li>Its SHA or MD5 hash is different from the hash computed when the last compile was done. </li>
          <li>One of the classes generated from it does not exist anymore. </li>
          <li>Its last modified time is older than that of one of the libraries it depends on </li>
         </ol>
         <p></p>
         <p>Once a source is detected as out of date, there are three recompilation strategies: </p>
         <ol>
          <li>Recompile only the sources directly out of date. </li>
          <li>Recompile the sources directly out of date and all sources that (transitively) depend on them. </li>
          <li>Recompile all sources. </li>
         </ol>
         <p></p>
         <p>Finally, when a source is out of date (directly or indirectly), its classes should be deleted. </p>
         <p>Through version 0.3.6, <tt>sbt</tt> used methods 1, 3, 5, and 6 combined to detect changes and recompilation strategy 2. Version 0.3.7 and higher of <tt>sbt</tt> substitutes change detection method 4 (comparing hashes) for method 3 (comparing last modified times) because of the following problems with method 3: </p>
         <ol>
          <li>Changes to a source that produces no classes are not detected (works properly with change detection method 2 or 4). </li>
          <li>Changes to a source between starting a compilation and finishing it are not detected (works properly with 2 or 4). </li>
          <li>The resolution of the last modified time of a file can be as coarse as 1 second for many filesystems (addressed by 4). </li>
         </ol>
         <p>The last issue was especially a problem when implementing the scripted tests. An automated test script could setup, compile, update, and compile again within a second. The second compile wouldn't detect any changes because the last modified times were the same. </p>
         <p>One problem with hashing, though, is that it reads in every source file to calculate its hash. As a rough idea, this might take about 1 second per 10 MB of sources on a local filesystem. This mainly affects how long it takes to run <tt>compile</tt> on a project without any changes. Of course, change detection is configurable, so you can use the last modified method if desired. </p>
         <h2><a name="Example"></a>Example<a href="#Example" class="section_anchor"></a></h2>
         <p>As an example, consider the following two definitions: </p>
         <p><tt>A.scala</tt> </p>
         <pre class="prettyprint">object A {
    val x = B.y
}</pre>
         <p><tt>B.scala</tt> </p>
         <pre class="prettyprint">object B {
    val y = 5
}</pre>
         <p>Now, consider what happens if you were to delete <tt>B.scala</tt> but do not update <tt>A.scala</tt>. When you recompile, you should get an error because <tt>B</tt> no longer exists for <tt>A</tt> to reference. </p>
         <p>The first problem occurs if you do not recompile <tt>A.scala</tt>. This would happen if you do not take source dependencies into account and you only recompile directly modified sources (here, <tt>A.scala</tt> is out of date because it depends on <tt>B.scala</tt>, but <tt>A.scala</tt> is not directly modified). A solution for a build system without source dependency tracking would be to recompile all sources. Alternatively, it could omit <tt>A.scala</tt> from recompilation and consequently require the user to do a full clean and then compile in order to get a proper build. </p>
         <p>The second problem is that if you do not delete the classes for <tt>B</tt>, the compiler will still find the classes for <tt>B</tt> in the output directory. So, there will not be a compiler error even though you have recompiled <tt>A.scala</tt>. This shows that it is necessary to track the classes generated from a source file. You want to delete the classes for the sources being recompiled but not delete the classes for the sources not being recompiled. </p>
         <h1><a name="Testing"></a>Testing<a href="#Testing" class="section_anchor"></a></h1>
         <p>The scripted test framework is used to verify that <tt>sbt</tt> handles cases such as that described above. The steps to create a test are: </p>
         <ol>
          <li>Create an initial project in <tt>src/sbt-test/&lt;test-group&gt;/&lt;test-name&gt;/</tt> </li>
          <li>Determine a set of changes to apply to the project (put any new or modified files in a sub-directory called <tt>changes/</tt>) </li>
          <li>Create a script called <tt>test</tt> in the project directory that modifies the project and runs actions on the project </li>
          <li>Run the tests with the <tt>scripted</tt> action </li>
         </ol>
         <p>The directory structure for a test that verifies correctness in the case mentioned in the previous section might look like: </p>
         <pre class="prettyprint">  src/sbt-test/change-detection/remove-test/
     project/
        build.properties
     src/main/scala/
        A.scala
        B.scala
     test</pre>
         <p>The <tt>scripted</tt> action runs the test by copying the directory to the temporary directory for your system, loads the project, and runs the <tt>test</tt> script. For example, on a unix system, the above test might be run from <tt>/tmp/sbt_f723ecf/remove-test/</tt>, where the <tt>f723ecf</tt> part is randomly generated. </p>
         <p>The next section describes scripts and provides an example of the <tt>test</tt> script. </p>
