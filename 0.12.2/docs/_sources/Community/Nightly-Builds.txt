Nightly Builds
==============

Nightly builds are currently being published to |typesafe-snapshots|_.

To use a nightly build, follow the instructions for normal
:doc:`Setup </Getting-Started/Setup>`, except:

1. Download the launcher jar from one of the subdirectories of |nightly-launcher|.
   They should be listed in chronological order, so the most recent one will be last.
2. Call your script something like ``sbt-nightly`` to retain access to a
   stable ``sbt`` launcher.
3. The version number is the name of the subdirectory and is of the form
   ``0.13.x-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss``. Use this in a ``build.properties`` file.

Related to the third point, remember that an ``sbt.version`` setting in
``<build-base>/project/build.properties`` determines the version of sbt
to use in a project. If it is not present, the default version
associated with the launcher is used. This means that you must set
``sbt.version=yyyyMMdd-HHmmss`` in an existing
``<build-base>/project/build.properties``. You can verify the right
version of sbt is being used to build a project by running
``sbt-version``.

To reduce problems, it is recommended to not use a launcher jar for one
nightly version to launch a different nightly version of sbt.
